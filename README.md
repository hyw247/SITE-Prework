## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
* none

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
* This was my first html experience, it was a fresh and new coding language that I really enjoyed learning so this could be a challenge to me since I have no prior experience before this. I overcame it by learning through the tutorial, through it I was able to understand the concept of html and java. Besides that, I had also watched youtube videos to broaden my knowledge on html and java. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
* Some question I have for this game would be instead of showing what button the sound is coming from and asking user to repeat it, it would be a more challenging game if it plays a sound and asked user to guess what button the sound is coming from. For example, a sound is played, user has to test each sound from each button. User starts game by clicking on "start" button and the game begins. After the game starts, User will not be able to test button sounds. 
* How should I create a game with multiple user playing on this game and compete with one another with a ranking system?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
* If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would try out some optional features and add them into the game. Another feature is to add a timer for the user to make this game more exciting and thrilling. Furthermore, from what I have mentioned above, I would love to try making the game more difficult for the user to play. As this is a memory game, letting user to guess the sound without showing them which sound the button is coming from would make it more challenging and test their memory skills.
